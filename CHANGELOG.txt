## 0.2.8

* Fixed keyword argument bug. Changed '-' to '_' to make valid keywords (thanks to Emma for finding this bug!)
* Added add_noise() - untested as of yet

## 0.2.7

* Fixed an exponent error in the temperature derivative of the H3+ partition function, dQdT
* Removed negative line width sanity check - failed when fitting polynomial expressions of the sigma
* Now sorting the get_results() and print_vars() output
* Added get_rest_wavelength() which returns the offset wavelength scale at H3+ rest wavelengths 

## 0.2.6

* Fixed major fitting but, mainly seen at low spectral resolutions when line-blending is strong
* Introduced a verbose keyword in fit(), which helps debug things
* print_vars() lists the current set of variables the model works with
* Fixed error in the implementation of linear/quadratic offsets

## 0.2.5

* Introduced guess_density() and guess_offset() to aid the fitting process
* xlabel() and ylabel() provides the matplotlib formatted x and y label for wavelength and intensity respectively

## 0.2.2
